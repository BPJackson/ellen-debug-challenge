                When I was researching code school bootcamps I stumbled across gSchool and knew immediately that this is where I needed to be. I wanted a school that would not just improve my skillset but put me directly into the field and gain a position as a valued member of a web development team. With the knowledge I will gain in this class I am excited take my career to the next level. I am ready to learn the programming languages and fully immerse myself in this vibrant community of creative thinkers! I am still researching what companies are out there and what types of jobs I will qualify for upon graduating, and I am very encouraged the abundance of possiblities.</p><br><br>
